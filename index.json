However, solving the large-scale semidefinite relaxations underpinning this approach remains a formidable computational challenge. A dominant cost in many state-of-the-art (Burer-Monteiro factorization-based) certifiable estimation methods is solution verification (testing the global optimality of a given candidate solution), which entails computing a minimum eigenpair of a certain symmetric certificate matrix. In this paper, we show how to significantly accelerate this verification step, and thereby the overall speed of certifiable estimation methods. First, we show that the certificate matrices arising in the Burer-Monteiro approach generically possess spectra that make the verification problem expensive to solve using standard iterative eigenvalue methods. We then show how to address this challenge using preconditioned eigensolvers; specifically, we design a specialized solution verification algorithm based upon the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method together with a simple yet highly effective algebraic preconditioner. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world examples shows that our proposed verification scheme is very effective in practice, accelerating solution verification by up to 280x, and the overall Burer-Monteiro method by up to 16x, versus the standard Lanczos method when applied to relaxations derived from large-scale SLAM benchmarks.","tags":["Certifiable estimation","certifiable perception","global optimization","Burer-Monteiro factorization","semidefinite programming","convex relaxation"],"title":"Accelerating Certifiable Estimation with Preconditioned Eigensolvers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yulun Tian","Amrit Singh Bedi","Alec Koppel","Miguel Calvo-Fullana","David M.

This article reviews recent progress in SLAM, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of the environmental models used in SLAM systems (representation) and the performance of the algorithms used to estimate these models from data (inference). A prominent theme of recent SLAM research is the pursuit of environmental representations (including learned representations) that go beyond the classical attributes of geometry and appearance to model properties such as hierarchical organization, affordance, dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous agents with a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enabling more versatile and intelligent operation. A second major theme is a revitalized interest in the mathematical properties of the SLAM estimation problem itself (including its computational and information-theoretic performance limits); this work has led to the development of novel classes of certifiable and robust inference methods that dramatically improve the reliability of SLAM systems in real-world operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their ramifications for achieving robust, long-duration autonomy, and conclude with a discussion of open challenges and a perspective on future research directions.

Recent work has shown that convex relaxation provides an effective tool for computing, and certifying the correctness of, *globally optimal* SLAM solutions. This paper expands upon this prior work by demonstrating how to exploit the structure of the relaxed optimization problem to design very fast solvers, capable of computing globally optimal trajectories with thousands of poses in a fraction of a second. In particular, we describe several computational enhancements for accelerating the underlying Riemannian trust-region optimization method, including the use of structure-exploiting matrix decomposition, iterative linear-algebraic techniques, truncated-Newton methods, and preconditioning strategies. We also describe methods for accelerating the minimum-eigenvalue computation used to certify the optimality of a recovered estimate. We have incorporated these computational enhancements in an updated version of the SE-Sync library, and released the corresponding code online. Experimental results indicate that this enhanced implementation of SE-Sync is approximately twice as fast as GTSAM, a highly optimized, state-of-the-art library for SLAM.","tags":["SE-Sync","certifiably correct SLAM","pose-graph SLAM","global optimization","Riemannian optimization","semidefinite programming","convex relaxation"],"title":"Computational Enhancements for Certifiably Correct SLAM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David M.

Examples of this class include the foundational problems of pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) (in robotics), camera motion estimation (in computer vision), and sensor network localization (in distributed sensing), among others. This inference problem is typically formulated as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover *certifiably globally optimal* solutions of the special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an *exact* MLE so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to *verify* this fact *a posteriori*, thereby *certifying* the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semidefinite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem defined on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, *SE-Sync*. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync is capable of recovering certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.","tags":["SE-Sync","certifiably correct SLAM","pose-graph SLAM","global optimization","Riemannian optimization","semidefinite programming","convex relaxation"],"title":"SE-Sync: A Certifiably Correct Algorithm for Synchronization over the Special Euclidean Group","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David M.

However, this formulation does not naturally support *long-term* autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change.  In reality, \"everything changes and nothing stands still,” and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative *feature persistence model* that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the *persistence filter*, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment. By incorporating this feature persistence estimation into current state-of-the-art graphical mapping techniques, we obtain a flexible, computationally efficient, and information-theoretically rigorous framework for *lifelong* environmental modeling in an ever-changing world.","tags":["semi-static SLAM","feature persistence","persistence filter"],"title":"Towards Lifelong Feature-Based Mapping in Semi-Static Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Carlone","David M.

While these techniques often work well in practice, they do not provide guarantees on the quality of the estimate. This paper shows that *Lagrangian duality* is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given candidate solution. Our contribution is threefold. First, we discuss a revised formulation of the SLAM inference problem. We show that this formulation is probabilistically grounded and has the advantage of leading to an optimization problem with quadratic objective. The second contribution is the derivation of the corresponding *Lagrangian dual* problem. The SLAM dual problem is a (convex) *semidefinite program*, which can be solved reliably and globally by off-the-shelf solvers. The third contribution is to discuss the relation between the original SLAM problem and its dual. We show that from the dual problem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a candidate SLAM solution, and ultimately provide a certificate of optimality. Moreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal SLAM solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization. We present extensive (real and simulated) experiments supporting our claims and discuss practical relevance and open problems.","tags":["verification","SLAM","Lagrangian duality","global optimality"],"title":"Lagrangian Duality in 3D SLAM: Verification Techniques and Optimal Solutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Tron","David M.

A limitation of current approaches is that they relax the positive determinant constraint for the rotations: in consequence, if they fail to certify an optimal solution (i.e., if the duality gap is nonzero), one cannot determine if this is due to the relaxation itself, or if it is an intrinsic feature of the problem at hand. In this paper we show how one can include the determinant constraints in the derivation of the dual, thus showing that their relaxation is unnecessary. We show experimentally that this complete formulation does not lead to tangible differences with respect to the original, relaxed version. This indicates that the reasons for failure in providing a certificate of optimality are intrinsic to the problem, and that the determinant constraints are somehow redundant in common PGO instances.","tags":["verification","pose-graph SLAM","Lagrangian duality","global optimality"],"title":"On the Inclusion of Determinant Constraints in Lagrangian Duality for 3D SLAM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David M.

To address this limitation, in this paper we present a formulation of the SLAM M-estimation with the property that, by expanding the feasible set of the estimation program, we obtain a *convex relaxation* whose solution approximates the globally optimal solution of the SLAM inference problem and can be recovered using a smooth optimization method initialized at *any* feasible point.

While there do exist some computationally efficient algorithms (e.g. incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) or Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation (RISE)) for performing online incremental maximum likelihood estimation over these models, they generally require that the distribution of interest factors as a product of Gaussians, a rather restrictive assumption. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of performing efficient incremental online estimation over sparse factor graphs in the non-Gaussian case. Our main result is a method that generalizes iSAM and RISE by removing the assumption of Gaussian factors, thereby significantly expanding the class of distributions to which these algorithms can be applied. The generalization is achieved by means of a simple algebraic reduction that under relatively mild conditions (boundedness of each of the factors in the distribution of interest) enables an instance of the general maximum likelihood estimation problem to be reduced to an equivalent instance of least-squares minimization that can be solved efficiently online by application of iSAM or RISE. Through this construction we obtain robust, computationally efficient, and *mathematically correct* incremental online maximum likelihood estimators for non-Gaussian distributions over sparse factor graphs.","tags":["SLAM","robust estimation","non-Gaussian estimation","factor graph"],"title":"Robust Incremental Online Inference over Sparse Factor Graphs: Beyond the Gaussian Case","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David M.
