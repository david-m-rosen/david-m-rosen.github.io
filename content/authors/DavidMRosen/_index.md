I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (<a href="https://lids.mit.edu/">LIDS</a>) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/).  

I am broadly interested in the mathematical foundations of machine perception: optimization, geometry, algebra, statistical estimation, and information theory. My research applies analytical tools from these disciplines to build principled, computationally efficient, and **provably robust machine perception** systems that “just work” in the real world.
