**[14-Sep-2022]** Our new [paper](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/publication/score/SCORE.pdf) presents the first convex relaxation for the general multi-robot range-aided SLAM (RA-SLAM) problem.  We show how to reformulate RA-SLAM as a quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which can then be relaxed to a second-order cone program (SOCP).  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that this convex relaxation strategy enables the recovery of high-quality solutions on very challenging single- and multi-robot RA-SLAM problems involving thousands of poses and range measurements.  Congrats to lead author [Alan Papalia](https://alanpapalia.github.io/) for this very cool piece of work :-)!
