**[28-Jan-2022]** The [SE-Sync library](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync) is now even easier to use thanks to some new Python bindings!  Check out this Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync/blob/master/C%2B%2B/examples/PySESync.ipynb) for a minimal working example.

**[5-Jan-2022]**  Our new RA-L [paper](/publication/cidgik) describes how challenging inverse kinematics problems for highly-redundant manipulators can be efficiently and reliably solved through a clever combination of problem reformulation and convex relaxation.
